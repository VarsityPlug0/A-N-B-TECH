# For development (console output)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

# For production (SMTP)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'

    storage='128GB',
    color='Space Black',
    price=899.00,
    is_available=True
)
```

### Modifying Document Requirements
Update the `get_missing_documents()` method in the Application model:

```python
def get_missing_documents(self):
    required_docs = ['bank_statement', 'id_picture', 'new_document']
    uploaded_docs = [doc.document_type for doc in self.user.documents.all()]
    return [doc for doc in required_docs if doc not in uploaded_docs]
```

### Custom Email Templates
Modify the `send_application_email()` function in `views.py` to customize email content and formatting.
